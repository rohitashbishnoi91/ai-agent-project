# 🚀 Streamlit Cloud Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy your AI Agent to Streamlit Cloud successfully.

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

✅ **Repository Status**: All files committed and pushed to GitHub  
✅ **Dependencies**: All packages working locally  
✅ **Configuration**: Streamlit config files added  
✅ **System Dependencies**: packages.txt created for lxml support  

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Deployment

### 1. Go to Streamlit Cloud
Visit [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io) and sign in with your GitHub account.

### 2. Create New App
- Click "New app"
- Select your repository: `rohitashbishnoi91/ai-agent-project`
- Select branch: `main`
- Main file path: `app.py`

### 3. Configure Environment Variables (Optional)
If you want to use Hugging Face API:
- Click "Advanced settings"
- Add environment variable:
  - **Key**: `HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY`
  - **Value**: Your Hugging Face token

### 4. Deploy
- Click "Deploy!"
- Wait for the build process to complete

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: lxml Build Error
**Error**: `Please make sure the libxml2 and libxslt development packages are installed`

**Solution**: 
- The `packages.txt` file is already included
- Streamlit Cloud will automatically install these system dependencies

### Issue 2: Import Errors
**Error**: `ModuleNotFoundError` or import failures

**Solution**:
- All dependencies are in `requirements.txt`
- The app has been tested with `deploy_test.py`

### Issue 3: App Not Loading
**Error**: App shows error or doesn't start

**Solution**:
- Check the logs in Streamlit Cloud dashboard
- Ensure `app.py` is the main file
- Verify all imports are working

### Issue 4: Hugging Face API Issues
**Error**: API authentication or rate limiting

**Solution**:
- The app has a robust fallback system
- It will work even without the API key
- Check your Hugging Face token permissions

## 🧪 Testing Your Deployment

1. **Local Test**: Run `python deploy_test.py` to verify compatibility

## 🔍 Monitoring Your App

- **Logs**: Check Streamlit Cloud dashboard for error logs
- **Performance**: Monitor app response times
- **Usage**: Track user interactions and API calls

## 🆘 If Deployment Still Fails

1. **Check Logs**: Look at the detailed error messages in Streamlit Cloud
